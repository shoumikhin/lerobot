"""Export a trained pi0.5 policy as ExecuTorch programs that run on ExecuTorch's CUDA backend.

The CUDA backend compiles each program with AOTInductor into CUDA and Triton kernels, without
TensorRT, and saves its weights in a `.ptd` file beside it. Run it on the device the policy will
run on, because the kernels are tuned for the GPU that compiles them:

    python examples/export/pi05_executorch_cuda.py \
        --policy.path=outputs/train/pi05_so101/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model \
        --task="pick up the block and place it in the cup"

Then run the exported folder with `lerobot-rollout --policy.path=<folder>`, with the same task.

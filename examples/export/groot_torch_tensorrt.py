"""Export a trained GR00T N1.7 policy as AOTInductor packages that run on TensorRT.

Run it on the device the policy will run on, because a TensorRT engine only runs on the GPU
model that built it:

    python examples/export/groot_torch_tensorrt.py \
        --policy.path=outputs/train/groot_so101/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model \
        --dataset.repo_id=<user>/so101_dataset

Then run the exported folder with `lerobot-rollout --policy.path=<folder>`, with the same task.
Running it needs PyTorch and Torch-TensorRT.

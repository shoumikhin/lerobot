    This skips randomly initializing weights that the checkpoint replaces, and never holds a second full copy
    of them. Returns None, before reading any weight, when the file cannot be read, it misses a key the policy
    has or holds one with another shape, or the policy shares a parameter or computed a buffer from one.
    `from_pretrained` then builds the policy and calls `load_state_dict`. Errors while reading the weights
    raise. Weights the policy does not have are skipped. The regular path gives the same weights: it copies
    every other weight, then catches the error about the extra ones.

    Only a class that sets `_supports_meta_load` in its own body takes this path, so a subclass has to opt in.
    That promises the constructor never reads, moves or holds on to a parameter, that
    `_fix_pytorch_state_dict_keys` handles each key on its own and only renames, copies or drops values (this
    path calls it once per key and uses only names and shapes), and that `_prepare_pretrained_state_dict`,
    which this path skips, changes nothing in a complete checkpoint.
